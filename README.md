# Expense-Tracker

The program is a python GUI application using Qt framework (https://www.qt.io/) and Qt designer tool (https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtdesigner-manual.html).

I wrote the application to practise working with SQL and sqlite database. Main aim was also to write a simple
application to track my expenses and expenses of other persons in my family. I wanted to know what and who I spend the most money on.
